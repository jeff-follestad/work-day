Work Day Scheduler helps employees manage their busy schedules.

Users can add important events to a daily planner and manager their time more effectively.

# Features Overview

* When a user opens the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
* The user is presented with time blocks for standard business hours as they scroll down.
* Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
* Users can enter and save hourly events which are saved in local storage.
* Saved events persist when the page is refreshed.
